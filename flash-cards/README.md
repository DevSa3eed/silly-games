It's a flashcard program,
and it shows you the front and the back of the card. So for example,
French, demande. In English means request. After three seconds,
the card flips and I can check whether if I knew the right answer.

If I got it right I'll press the tick and if I got it wrong
I'll press the cross. So let's try another word.
Parti means left or to leave. Attendez
means to wait
and I think I knew that word. So I'm going to click the check mark.
And what that's going to do is it's going to take the flashcard out of all of
the list of flashcards so it doesn't show me the things I already know.
And instead it only shows me the things I don't know
